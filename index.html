                                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
                                            <p>A NLP and Sentiment Analysis application that analyses large text corpuses, initially represented by open ended responses to a survey applied to a group of persons.</p>
                                            <p>The Topic Model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to the text corpus and a number of topics were outputted with their corresponding Sentiment Analysis.</p>
                                            <p>This application served as a listening tool for the business that applied its results to suggest a change management for their customers.</p>

                                            <p>Decision makers take decisions commonly based on data that is collected from various sources. I would like to demonstrate that by having a unique source of data (a database) for performing analysis, it is possible to speed up greatly the process of extracting insight by data scientist to assist the decision making.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
                                            <p>I built a structured repository of data from unstructured data, scraped from two websites and placed it in a PostgreSQL database, allowing data scientist to perform inferences over this readily available data.</p>

The basic idea behind TMs is that, given a large unstructured text, the hidden topics are discovered. TMs are directed to answer the question: “what is this text talking about?”. This concept is illustrated in Figure 1 using a toy example (as the text analyzed may contain billions of words). Here, each of the words from the text is assigned to a topic, i.e., a list of related words on the same subject. The output of a TM is the most likely words per each of the most likely topics. We will see later that the number of topics and the number of words are parameterizable. A more formal definition of TMs, is that they are a set of machine learning techniques aimed to extract the thematic structure in a massive collection of documents. These are Information Recovery (IR) / Data Mining (DM) techniques that use the texts latent information for clustering the documents; i.e., grouping them according to the similarity found amongst them.</p>
